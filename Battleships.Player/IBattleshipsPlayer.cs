    ///     games wins the match. A single player object is created and used for
    ///     the entire match.
    ///     The game is played on a board with rows labelled 'A' to 'J' and columns
    ///     labelled '1' to '10'.
    ///     The aim of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they

    ///     been hit by their opponent.)
    ///     A game starts with each player declaring the positions of their own
    ///     ships to the adjudicator.
    ///     Then one player is asked to choose a square to fire on and is notified
    ///     of the result of their shot. Their opponent then gets a chance to fire.
    ///     This continues until all of one player's ships are sunk.
    ///     If a player fails to provide valid ship positions or throws an exception
    ///     that player immediately forfeits the game.
